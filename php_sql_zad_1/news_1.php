        <h1>1940s</h1>
        <h3>As had happened 25 years previously, the outbreak of the Second World War brought a halt to the 
            Football League and FA Cup competitions.</h2>
        <p>Both tournaments were cancelled early in the 1939/40 season, with West Ham United’s Second 
            Division campaign ended at the start of September, just three games in. Six weeks later, 
            a regional competition began, with the Hammers in League South alongside nine other London 
            and South Coast clubs.</p>
        <p>With uncertainty due to the escalation of hostilities and many players unavailable, the season 
            was split into two parts. The Irons did well in both, finishing second in League A, which 
            ended in February 1940, and League C, which ran until June 1940.</p>
        <p>A knockout competition was also held, the Football League War Cup, and again Charlie Paynter’s 
            squad showed up positively, defeating Chelsea, Leicester City, Huddersfield Town and 
            Birmingham to set up a semi-final with Fulham. A thrilling 4-3 win saw the Hammers reach the 
            final, where they would face Blackburn Rovers at Wembley Stadium on 8 June 1940.</p>
        <p>There, in front of 42,399 brave supporters, who braved the threat of a Nazi air raid, Sam 
            Small scored the only goal of the game to secure a welcome piece of silverware and boost the 
            morale of east Londoners who had already been targeted by the Luftwaffe. It was an historic 
            moment for the Hammers, who won at what had become the national stadium for the first time 
            and collected their first piece of silverware since lifting the London Challenge Cup a 
            decade before.</p>
        <p>Those bombing raids would increase hugely in September of the same year, when the eight-month 
            long Blitz began. As had occurred during the First World War, West Ham players had signed-up 
            to join the war effort. Among those who did so was Scottish goalkeeper Norman Corbett, who 
            had made his first-team debut in a Second Division win over Sheffield United in May 1937 and 
            totalled 42 appearances before the outbreak of the Second World War.</p>
