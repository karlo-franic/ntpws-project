        <h1>1960s</h1>
        <h3>If the Academy of Football was born in the 1950s, then the 1960s was the decade during 
            which it came of age.</h2>
        <p>The most-successful period in West Ham United’s history saw the Club win the FA Cup, the 
            European Cup Winners’ Cup and, so say many, the FIFA World Cup.</p>
        <p>While West Ham never came close to winning the Football League title, the team and its 
            visionary managers, Ted Fenton and then Ron Greenwood, earned rave reviews at home and 
            abroad for their innovative approach to the beautiful game.</p>
        <p>On their day, West Ham were capable of beating anyone, as was evidenced by the series of 
            eye-catching victories they achieved over England’s top sides. From front to back, back 
            to front, the Hammers were blessed with elegant ball-players who could tear any opponent 
            apart.</p>
        <p>The majority of those players honed their skills on the green fields of Little Heath and 
            Chadwell Heath, home-grown heroes such as Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters, Ronnie 
            Boyce, Ken Brown, John Sissons, Jack Burkett, Eddie Bovington and Brian Dear.</p>
        <p>When those Academy combined with the likes of goalkeeper Jim Standen and forwards Johnny 
            Byrne and Alan Sealey, the Hammers could play football of a style rarely seen and rarely 
            matched, on these shores, at least.
            West Ham’s first major trophy arrived in 1964, when Greenwood guided his side through a 
            tricky FA Cup run to a Wembley showdown with Second Division Preston North End. As was 
            the nature of The West Ham Way, it came as no surprise that the final itself was a 
            rollercoaster affair settled 3-2 in the Hammers’ favour by Boyce’s late header.</p>
