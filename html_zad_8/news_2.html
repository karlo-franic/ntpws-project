        <h1>1950s</h1>
        <h3>For West Ham United, the 1950s was the decade when the world-famous ‘Academy of Football’ 
            truly came into being.</h2>
        <p>The process of identifying promising young players and developing them into ‘not only good 
            footballers, but good men’ began under the management of Ted Fenton. A wing-half who played 
            for the Club between 1932 and 1946, Fenton became assistant to Charlie Paynter in 1948 before 
            taking charge himself two years later.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Forest Gate, Fenton joined West Ham as a schoolboy before making his 
            first-team debut at 17 in 1932. He went on to make 383 appearances, including War-time 
            matches, scoring 63 goals.</p>
        <p>Having come through the system himself, Fenton saw the benefit of breeding his own players, 
            both on the pitch and financially, and set putting together a team of home-grown youngsters. 
            The 1950s saw the likes of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Ken Brown, Malcolm Musgrove, Ronnie 
            Boyce and Martin Peters recruited by Fenton and his staff, with many playing a central 
            role to West Ham’s outstanding success during the following decade.</p>
        <p>The home-produced talent was supplemented by the scouting and signing of able young players 
            from elsewhere, including Irishmen Noel Cantwell, Tommy Moroney and Frank O’Farrell, Scotsmen 
            John Dick and Jimmy Andrews, Kent-born Malcolm Allison, and north Essex-born pair Vic Keeble 
            and John Bond.</p>
        <p>The players embraced Fenton’s idea that they should spend time together off the pitch, discussing 
            their footballing philosophies, tactics and adopting nutritional diets to improve their level 
            of performance. Fenton also introduced continental ideas taken from, among others, the 
            outstanding Hungary team of the 1950s, revamping training methods and encouraging his players 
            to study coaching method themselves, often during afternoon sessions at Café Cassettari on 
            the nearby Barking Road. These innovative concepts combined to produce a new approach that 
            came to be known as ‘The West Ham Way’.</p>
